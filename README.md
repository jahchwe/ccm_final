This project explored the application of a Bayesian model concerning the categorical perception/perceptual magnet effect (Feldman & Griffiths, 2007) of speech to the domain of social perception. Specifically, I was interested in how the categories one already holds impacts the addition of a novel category. In this simulation, I explored how adding a category of "non-gendered" or "transgender" to a male/female gender dichotomy impacts categorical perception in this Bayesian framework.

This project was written up in the provided pdf. All code is contained in the final_proj.py script.
